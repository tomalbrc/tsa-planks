# Vertical and Chiseled Planks!

This mod adds chiseled and vertical planks of every wood type to your server (but also works in singleplayer).

It uses a resourcepack and distributes it to clients using polymer autohost.

No additional setup needed!

To disable the autohost functionality, set "forceAutoHost" to "false" in the filament config and disable it in the polymer configs!

Requires:
- [polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)
- [filament](https://modrinth.com/mod/filament)

and fabric api (used by both dependencies)

# Recipes

- Line of 3 (1x3) Planks vertically for vertical planks
- 2x2 vertical planks for chiseled planks

# Command

The blocks are in the "tsa" namespace, so to /give chiseled or vertical planks, do:

```
/give @... tsa:vertical_oak_planks

```

```
/give @... tsa:chiseled_oak_planks 
```

You can also `/polymer creative` to open polymer's creative menu and the filament blocks icon to access the blocks

## Caveat:
This mod uses noteblocks to display the custom blocks on a server without requiring the client to have installed any mods. This means that resourcepacks that use noteblocks may not work correctly for players
